# Pattern Generator Roadmap

## Pattern Options Available

### Currently Implemented in Console (3 options):
1. **wave** - Sinusoidal Waves pattern (Option 2: 📐)
2. **bump** - Flowing Dot Field pattern (Option 3: 🌀)
3. **contour** - Shape Contours pattern (Option 6: 🔷)

### Ready for Future Implementation (3 additional options):
4. **bouncing** - Bouncing Animation pattern (Option 1: 🌊)
5. **static** - Static Contours pattern (Option 4: 🎯)
6. **topographic** - Topographic Lines pattern (Option 5: 🗺️)

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed:
- All 6 pattern functions added to `src/utils/p5PatternGenerator.ts`
- Pattern type mapping updated in `src/GenerativePatternCanvas.tsx`
- Console interface updated with 3 new patterns: wave, bump, contour
- Original pattern logic implemented with proper initialization and settings
- Pattern functions ready for activation via `patternType` parameter

### 🔄 Ready for Future:
- 3 additional pattern types can be activated by:
  1. Adding pattern types to `Controls.jsx` component
  2. Updating UI to display all 6 options
  3. Pattern logic already exists and is ready to use

## Pattern Function Names:
- `drawBouncingAnimation()` - Bouncing Animation
- `drawSinusoidalWaves()` - Sinusoidal Waves  
- `drawFlowingDotField()` - Flowing Dot Field
- `drawStaticContours()` - Static Contours
- `drawTopographicLines()` - Topographic Lines
- `drawShapeContours()` - Shape Contours

## Pattern Type Values:
- `'wave'` - Sinusoidal Waves (currently active)
- `'bump'` - Flowing Dot Field (currently active)
- `'contour'` - Shape Contours (currently active)
- `'bouncing'` - Bouncing Animation (ready for future)
- `'static'` - Static Contours (ready for future)
- `'topographic'` - Topographic Lines (ready for future)

## Notes:
- All pattern functions copied from `/Users/jeremystokes/Desktop/generative_art/generative_art_system.html`
- Pattern functions use marching squares algorithm for contour generation
- Each pattern has specific shape, alignment, and stream count mappings
- New patterns set stream count to 0 as they handle their own rendering

## Upcoming Improvements:
- Fix positioning of bump map
- Fix generative image for the waves
- Change image of bump map to white
- Add feature for toggle of animation

## Recent Changes:
- ✅ Renamed frequency knob to scale knob - now controls dot size instead of particle count
- ✅ Updated UI labels and debug display to reflect scale control
- ✅ Implemented color tinting for all pattern types
